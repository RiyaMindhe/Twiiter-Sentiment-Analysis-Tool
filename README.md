Sentiment analysis, often referred to as opinion mining, is a subfield of natural language processing and data analysis that aims to determine the sentiment behind a series of words, used to gain an understanding of the attitudes, opinions, and emotions expressed within an online mention.

Below are the main types of sentiment analysis:

Binary Sentiment Analysis  
The most straightforward and basic form of sentiment analysis. It involves categorizing opinions into binary outputs like positive or negative, or sometimes even neutral.

Fine-Grained Sentiment Analysis  
This digs deeper than mere polarity detection by grading sentiments on a scale, such as ratings from one to five stars. It helps in distinguishing between levels of sentiment intensity by adding more outputs.

Emotion Detection  
Emotion detection seeks to understand specific emotional states conveyed in the text, such as happiness, anger, sadness, or surprise.

Intent Analysis  
The goal behind intent analysis is to understand the intent behind a text - whether a user intends to purchase, recommend, or complain about a product or service.

Multilingual Sentiment Analysis  
It involves analyzing sentiments across different languages, which requires understanding cultural nuances and linguistic idiosyncrasies.
